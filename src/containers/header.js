/**
 * Let's connect this bad boy with Redux, and our Header component.

/**
 * Your component needs access to the `header` portion of the state.  Ensure your `mapStateToProps` has a `header`
 * property that connects to the right part of the state object.
 */

/**
 * The container already has an addHeader method property.  Ensure `mapDispatchToProps` receives a matching action!
